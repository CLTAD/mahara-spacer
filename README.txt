# Spacer

### A super-simple Mahara plugin for spacing page elements

This is probably the simplest Mahara plugin possible, but I have found that it is used frequently by students at my insitution, so it may be useful to others, or might make a useful example for those starting Mahara development.


## Requirements
---
Should work with most versions of Mahara - test on 1.4, 1.5, 1.6



## Installation
---

* Copy the 'spacer' folder to your Mahara installation, inside the folder htdocs/blocktype.
* Visit the Site Administration->Extensions->Plugin administration page and install the spacer plugin.


## Usage
---

The Spacer content block appears under the General content type when creating pages. Drag it onto your page and set the height. Remove the block title if you want a truly empty page space.
